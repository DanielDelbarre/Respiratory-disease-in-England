# The relationship between chronic respiratory disease and urban areas

This is a project which uses publically available National Health Service (NHS) medical prescriptions data to study the prevalence of respiratory disease in England. In this project I look at the relationship between respiratory disease and urban areas, latitude. I also produce a map of prescription data for respiratory diseases, highlighting areas with elevated levels of disease.
